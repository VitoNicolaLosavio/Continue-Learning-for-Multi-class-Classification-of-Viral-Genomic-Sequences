# # Continue Learning for Multi-class Classification of Viral Genomic Sequences

## Description

This project focuses on the classification of DNA and RNA strands of viruses belonging to four different families (Geminiviridae, Hepadnaviridae, Orthomyxviridae, Circoviridae) using machine learning techniques. The objective is to develop a model capable of distinguishing between these viral families through a pipeline divided into three main phases:

1. Model Creation: A CNN-LSTM (Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory) based model was developed.
2. Application of the Model on the Unbalanced Dataset: The model was trained and evaluated on an unbalanced dataset using the continuous learning technique.
3. Application of the Model on the Balanced Dataset: The model was trained and evaluated on a balanced dataset using the continuous learning technique. To balance the dataset, the SMOTEEN (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique and Edited Nearest Neighbors) technique was applied for oversampling.
